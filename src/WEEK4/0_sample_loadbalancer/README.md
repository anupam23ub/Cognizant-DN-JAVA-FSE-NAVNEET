# Exercise 1 – Implementing Edge Services for Routing and Filtering

## Objective

Implement an API Gateway that routes incoming client requests to backend services while applying a custom global logging filter.

---

## Concepts Covered

- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Route Predicates
- Route Configuration
- Global Gateway Filters
- Request Logging
- Response Logging

---

## Implemented Features

- Spring Cloud Gateway configuration
- Path Predicate Routing
- `/example/**` route
- Global Logging Filter
- Request URI logging
- Response Status logging
- Non-blocking request processing using Spring WebFlux

---

## Files Implemented

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| ApiGatewayLoadBalancingExercisesApplication.java | Main Spring Boot Application |
| LoggingFilter.java | Global Request Logging Filter |
| application.yml | Gateway Route Configuration |

---

## Gateway Route

```text
/example/**

↓

Logging Filter

↓

External Service
```

---

## Test Command

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/example/get
```

---

## Expected Output

- Incoming request logged
- Request routed successfully
- Response status logged

---

# Exercise 2 – Load Balancing in an API Gateway

## Objective

Implement client-side load balancing using **Spring Cloud Gateway** and **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer**.

| application.yml | Load Balanced Route Configuration |

---

## Request Flow

```text
Client

↓

Gateway

↓

Random Load Balancer

↓

Service Instance A
or
Service Instance B
```

---

## Test Command

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/loadbalanced/get
```

Run the above command multiple times to observe requests distributed across different service instances.

---

## Expected Output

- Requests distributed randomly
- Gateway forwards requests successfully
- Load Balancer selects backend instance

- Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Fault Tolerance
- Gateway Filters
- Fallback Mechanism
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Health Monitoring

↓

Backend Available ?
      │
 ┌────┴────┐
 │         │
Yes        No
 │         │
 ▼         ▼
Backend   Fallback API
Response  Response
```

---

## Test Commands

### Gateway Route

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/resilience/get
```

### Fallback Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:8081/fallback/example
```

---

## Expected Output

- Gateway forwards requests normally while backend is healthy.
- Circuit Breaker monitors failures.
- Requests are redirected to the fallback endpoint when the backend service is unavailable.
- Health information is exposed through Spring Boot Actuator.
